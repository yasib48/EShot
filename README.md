- Added eyedropper tool for picking colors directly from the screen
- Added semi-transparent rectangle tool for filled highlights
- Added selection lock to prevent accidental movement while annotating
- Added adjustable blur intensity
- Added multiline text support
- Improved toolbar placement around the selected area
- Improved undo and redo button states
- Improved update notification behavior through the tray icon
- Fixed selection, toolbar, startup, and installer regressions found during the v2.4.0 cycle

## Features

### Capture

- Capture a selected region from the screen
- Move and resize the selected area before saving or copying
- Keep the dimension label anchored to the selected area
- Copy, save, upload, pin, annotate, or run OCR from the capture toolbar

### Annotation

EShot includes the common tools needed for fast screenshot markup:

- Freehand pen
- Arrow and line
- Rectangle and ellipse
- Semi-transparent rectangle
- Text and multiline text
- Blur with adjustable intensity
- Crop
- Eyedropper color picker
- Undo and redo

Annotations snap to selection edges where useful, and toolbars reposition automatically when there is not enough screen space outside the selected region.

### GIF Recording

Record a selected part of the screen as a GIF. Recording settings include FPS, maximum duration, and loop behavior.

### OCR

EShot can extract text from a selected area using Tesseract OCR. The installer can include the main OCR engine and selectable language packs, including English, Turkish, Russian, German, French, Spanish, and Italian.

### Upload

Upload screenshots directly from the capture toolbar. Supported services:

- Catbox
- Uguu

Catbox and Uguu work without an API key.

### Pin to Desktop

Pinned screenshots stay above other windows, making them useful for reference images, snippets, notes, UI comparisons, and quick visual memory.

### Settings

The settings window includes:

- General behavior
- Capture behavior
- Recording options
- Appearance options
- Interface options
- Hotkey configuration

Settings can be exported and imported, and hotkey combinations are validated before being saved.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Default shortcuts can be changed in Settings.

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Print Screen` | Start capture |
| `Enter` | Confirm/copy selected capture |
| `Ctrl+C` | Copy selected capture |
| `Esc` | Cancel capture or close active overlay |
